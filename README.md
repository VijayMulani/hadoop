Watch this space for exploring hadoop along with me.

# What we'll use : Docker
Docker is a light weight VM upon which we will install Cloudera's hadoop distribution. Lets see this setp by step.
You can find and install the docker toolbox from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox (Mac and windows)

Run command : docker-machine create -d virtualbox default
